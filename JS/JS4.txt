On March 7, 2018, I directed the Board of Immigration Appeals (“Board”) to refer for my review its decision in this matter, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(h)(1)(i), and I invited the parties and any interested amici to submit briefs addressing questions relevant to that certification. Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 227 (A.G. 2018). Specifically, I sought briefing on whether, and under what circumstances, being a victim of private criminal activity constitutes a cognizable “particular social group” for purposes of an application for asylum or withholding of removal.
For the reasons set forth in the accompanying opinion, I vacate the Board’s December 6, 2016 decision and remand this case to the immigration judge for further proceedings. Consistent with the test developed by the Board over the past several decades, an applicant seeking to establish persecution on account of membership in a “particular social group” must satisfy two requirements. First, the applicant must demonstrate membership in a group, which is composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, is defined with particularity, and is socially distinct within the society in question. And second, the applicant’s membership in that group must be a central reason for her persecution. When, as here, the alleged persecutor is someone unaffiliated with the government, the applicant must show that flight from her country is necessary because her home government is unwilling or unable to protect her.
Although there may be exceptional circumstances when victims of private criminal activity could meet these requirements, they must satisfy established standards when seeking asylum. Such applicants must establish membership in a particular and socially distinct group that exists independently of the alleged underlying harm, demonstrate that their persecutors harmed them on account of their membership in that group rather than for personal reasons, and establish that the government protection from such harm in their home country is so lacking that their persecutors’ actions can be attributed to the government. Because Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 388 (BIA 2014), recognized a new particular social group without correctly applying these standards, I overrule that case and any other Board precedent to the extent those other decisions are inconsistent with the legal conclusions set forth in this opinion.
OPINION
The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) authorizes the Attorney General to grant asylum if an alien is unable or unwilling to return to her country of origin because she has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of “race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1)(a), (b)(i). A recurring question in asylum law is determining whether alleged persecution was based on their membership in a “particular social group.” Over the past thirty years, this question has recurred frequently before the Board and the courts of appeals, and the standard has evolved over time.
The prototypical refugee flees her home country because the government has persecuted her—either directly through its own actions or indirectly by being unwilling or unable to prevent the misconduct of non-government actors—based upon a statutorily protected ground. Where the persecutor is not part of the government, the immigration judge must consider both the reason for the harm inflicted on the asylum applicant and the government’s role in sponsoring or enabling such actions. An alien may suffer threats and violence in a foreign country for any number of reasons relating to her social, economic, family, or other personal circumstances. Yet the asylum statute does not provide redress for all misfortune. It applies when persecution arises on account of membership in a protected group and the victim may not find protection except by taking refuge in another country.
The INA does not define “persecution on account of . . . membership in a particular social group.” The Board first addressed the term in Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985), where it interpreted a “particular social group” in a manner consistent with the other four grounds of persecution identified in section 1101(a)(42)(A)—race, religion, nationality, or political opinion. Id. The Board concluded that a “particular social group” required a “group of persons all of whom share a common, immutable characteristic” that “the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.” Id. The Board noted that the “shared characteristic might be an innate one such as sex, color, or kinship ties, or in some circumstances, it might be a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.” Id.
In Matter of R-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 906, 917–23 (BIA 1999) (en banc), the Board considered whether a victim of domestic violence could establish refugee status as a member of a particular social group consisting of similarly situated women. The Board held that the mere existence of shared circumstances would not turn those possessing such characteristics into a particular social group. Id. at 919. Rather, the members of a particular social group must not merely share an immutable characteristic, but must also be recognized as a distinct group in the alien’s society, id. at 918–19, and the persecution must be motivated by membership in that social group, id. at 919–22. Attorney General Reno vacated that decision for reconsideration in light of a proposed regulation, see 22 I&N Dec. 906, 906 (A.G. 2001), but no final rule ever issued, and the case was eventually resolved in 2009 without further consideration by the Board. Despite the vacatur of R-A-, both the Board and the federal courts have continued to treat its analysis as persuasive.
In the years after Matter of R-A-, the Board refined the legal standard for particular social groups. By 2014, the Board had clarified that applicants for asylum seeking relief based on “membership in a particular social group” must establish that their purported social group is “(1) composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinct within the society in question.” Matter of M-E-V-G, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 237 (BIA 2014). Applicants must also show that their membership in the particular social group was a central reason for their persecution. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208, 224 (BIA 2014). Where an asylum applicant claims that the persecution was inflicted by private conduct, she must also establish that the government was unable or unwilling to protect her. See, e.g., Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 222.
Later that year, the Board decided A-R-C-G-, which recognized “married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship” as a particular social group—without performing the rigorous analysis required by the Board’s precedents. 26 I&N Dec. at 389; see id. at 390–95. Instead, the Board accepted the concessions by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) that the respondent suffered harm rising to the level of past persecution, that she was a member of a qualifying particular social group, and that her membership in that group was a central reason for her persecution. Id. at 395.
I do not believe A-R-C-G- correctly applied the Board’s precedents, and I now overrule it. The opinion has caused confusion because it recognized an expansive new category of particular social groups based on private violence. Since that decision, the Board, immigration judges, and asylum officers have relied upon it as an affirmative statement of law, even though the decision assumed its conclusion and did not perform the necessary legal and factual analysis. When confronted with asylum cases based on purported membership in a particular social group, the Board, immigration judges, and asylum officers must analyze the requirements as set forth in this opinion, which restates and where appropriate, elaborates upon, the requirements set forth in M-E-V-G and W-G-R-.
In this matter, the immigration judge initially denied the respondent’s asylum claim, which arises out of allegations of domestic abuse suffered in El Salvador. In reversing the immigration judge’s decision, the Board did little more than cite A-R-C-G- in finding that she met her burden of establishing that she was a member of a particular social group. In addition to failing meaningfully to consider that question or whether the respondent’s persecution was on account of her membership in that group, the Board gave insufficient deference to the factual findings of the immigration judge.
For these and other reasons, I vacate the Board’s decision and remand for further proceedings before the immigration judge consistent with this opinion. In so doing, I reiterate that an applicant for asylum on account of her membership in a purported particular social group must demonstrate: (1) membership in a particular group, which is composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, is defined with particularity, and is socially distinct within the society in question; (2) that her membership in that group is a central reason for her persecution; and (3) that the alleged harm is inflicted by the government of her home country or by persons that the government is unwilling or unable to control. See M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 234–44; W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at 209–18, 223–24 & n.8.
Furthermore, when the applicant is the victim of private criminal activity, the analysis must also “consider whether government protection is available, internal relocation is possible, and persecution exists countrywide.” M-E-V- G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 243.
Generally, claims by aliens pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by non-governmental actors will not qualify for asylum.1 While I do not decide that violence inflicted by non-governmental actors may never serve as the basis for an asylum or withholding application based on membership in a particular social group, in practice such claims are unlikely to satisfy the statutory grounds for proving group persecution that the government is unable or unwilling to address. The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes—such as domestic violence or gang violence—or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim.
I. 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, entered the United States illegally and was apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in July 2014. After being placed in removal proceedings, the respondent filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal under 1 Accordingly, few such claims would satisfy the legal standard to determine whether an alien has a credible fear of persecution. See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v) (requiring a “significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the alien’s claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum under section 1158 of this title [8 U.S.C. § 1158]”).  the INA, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, 1231(b)(3), and for withholding of removal under the regulations implementing the United Nations Convention Against Torture.
The respondent claimed that she was eligible for asylum because she was persecuted on account of her membership in the purported particular social group of “El Salvadoran women who are unable to leave their domestic relationships where they have children in common” with their partners. Matter of A-B-, Decision Denying Asylum Application at *8, (Immig. Ct. Dec. 1, 2015). The respondent asserted that her ex-husband, with whom she shares three children, repeatedly abused her physically, emotionally, and sexually during and after their marriage. Id. at *2–3).
In December 2015, the immigration judge denied all relief and ordered the respondent removed to El Salvador. The immigration judge denied the respondent’s asylum claim for four independent reasons: (1) the respondent was not credible; (2) the group in which she claimed membership did not qualify as a “particular social group” within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); (3) even if it did, the respondent failed to establish that her membership in a social group was a central reason for her persecution; and
(4) she failed to show that the El Salvadoran government was unable or unwilling to help her. Id. at *4–15. The respondent appealed the immigration judge’s decision to the Board.
In December 2016, the Board reversed and remanded with an order to grant the respondent asylum after the completion of background checks. Matter of A-B-, (BIA Dec. 8, 2016). The Board found the immigration judge’s adverse credibility determinations clearly erroneous. Id. at *1–2. The Board further concluded that the respondent’s particular social group was substantially similar to “married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship,” which the Board had recognized in Matter of A- R-C-G- , 26 I&N Dec. at 390. A-B- at *2. Moreover, the Board held that the immigration judge clearly erred in finding that the respondent could leave her ex-husband, and that the respondent established that her ex-husband persecuted her because of her status as a Salvadoran woman unable to leave her domestic relationship. Id. at *2–3. Finally, the Board determined that the El Salvadoran government was unwilling or unable to protect the respondent. Id. at *3–4.
In August 2017, the immigration judge issued an order purporting to certify and administratively return the matter to the Board in light of intervening developments in the law.2 Matter of A-B-, Decision and Order

2 As explained in my order of March 30, Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 247, 248–49 (A.G. 2018), the immigration judge’s sua sponte order purporting to certify the matter back to the Board was procedurally defective because the immigration judge had not issued any of Certification, (Immig. Ct. Aug. 18, 2017). The immigration judge observed that several courts of appeals had recently held that domestic- violence victims failed to prove their entitlement to asylum based on membership in particular social groups. See id. at *2–3 (citing Fuentes- Erazo v. Sessions, 848 F.3d 847, 853 (8th Cir. 2017); Cardona v. Sessions,
848 F.3d 519, 523 (1st Cir. 2017); Marikasi v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 281, 291 (6th Cir. 2016); Vega-Ayala v. Lynch, 833 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 2016)). The immigration judge thus believed that the precedents relied upon by the Board in its December 2016 decision were no longer good law. A-B- at *3–4 (Immig. Ct. Aug. 18, 2017).
In particular, the immigration judge cited the Fourth Circuit’s opinion in Velasquez v. Sessions, 866 F.3d 188 (4th Cir. 2017), which denied the petition for review on the ground that the alien had not established that her alleged persecution was on account of her membership in a particular social group. A-B- at *3–4 (Immig. Ct. Aug. 18, 2017) (citing Velasquez, 866 F.3d at 197). Distinguishing A-R-C-G- because of DHS’s concessions there, 866 F.3d at 195 n.5, the court in Velasquez reiterated that “‘[e]vidence consistent with acts of private violence or that merely shows that an individual has been the victim of criminal activity does not constitute evidence of persecution on a statutorily protected ground.’” Id. at 194 (quoting Sanchez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir. 2004)). The court further noted, “‘the asylum statute was not intended as a panacea for the numerous personal altercations that invariably characterize economic and social relationships.’” Id. at 195 (quoting Saldarriaga v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 461, 467 (4th Cir.
2005)).  In a concurrence, Judge Wilkinson reiterated that the particular social groups protected from persecution under the asylum statute must be understood in the context of the other grounds for protection, which concern specific segments of the population who are marginalized or subjected to social stigma and prejudice. Id. at 198 (Wilkinson, J., concurring). Noting that victims of private violence were “seizing upon the ‘particular social group’ criterion in asylum applications,” Judge Wilkinson considered the example of applicants who claim to be the victims of gang violence. Aliens seeking asylum on that basis “are often not ‘exposed to more violence or human rights violations than other segments of society,’ and ‘not in a substantially different situation from anyone who has crossed the gang, or who is perceived to be a threat to the gang’s interests.’” Id. at 199 (quoting Matter of S-E-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 579, 587 (BIA 2008)). He recognized that the Board “has previously explained that ‘victims of gang violence come from all segments of society, and it is difficult to conclude that any “group,” decision for the Board to review. Neither the immigration judge nor the Board has taken any other actions in this matter since the Board issued its December 2016 decision.
as actually perceived by the criminal gangs, is much narrower than the general population.’” Id. (quoting M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 250). The pervasive nature of this violent criminality, in Judge Wilkinson’s view, suggested that membership in a purported particular social group “is often not a central reason for the threats received, but rather is secondary to a grander pattern of criminal extortion that pervades petitioners’ societies.” Id. On March 7, 2018, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(h)(1)(i), I directed the Board to refer this matter to me for my review. I invited the parties and any interested amici to submit briefs on the following question:

Whether, and under what circumstances, being a victim of private criminal activity constitutes a cognizable “particular social group” for purposes of an application for asylum or withholding of removal. A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 227. After certifying this case, I received party submissions from the respondent and DHS and twelve amicus briefs.

II.
As a threshold matter, I address the respondent’s procedural objections concerning my authority to review this case and the certification procedure.

A.

The respondent argues that I lack the authority to certify the Board’s decision because it did not reacquire jurisdiction following its remand to the immigration judge. In the respondent’s view, the Attorney General’s authority to certify and review immigration cases is restricted to cases over which the Board expressly retains jurisdiction, excluding any cases that have been remanded for further proceedings. This restrictive interpretation of my jurisdiction finds no support in the law.
Under the INA, “[t]he Attorney General enjoys broad powers with respect to ‘the administration and enforcement of [the INA itself] and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.’” Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 272, 279 (4th Cir. 2004) (quoting 8 U.S.C. §
1103(a)(1)); see also Henderson v. INS, 157 F.3d 106, 126 (2d Cir. 1998) (“[T]he extraordinary and pervasive role that the Attorney General plays in immigration matters is virtually unique.”); Matter of D-J-, 23 I&N Dec. 572, 573–74 & n.3 (A.G. 2003) (describing Attorney General’s review authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)). The INA grants the Attorney General the authority to “review such administrative determinations in immigration proceedings, delegate such authority, and perform such other acts as the Attorney General determines to be necessary for carrying out” his duties related  to   the   immigration  and  naturalization  of  aliens.	8 U.S.C. § 1103(g)(2). This authority includes the power to refer cases for my review, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(h)(1), which the First Circuit has called an “unfettered grant of authority,” Xian Tong Dong v. Holder, 696 F.3d 121, 124 (1st Cir. 2012). Nothing in the INA or the implementing regulations precludes the Attorney General from referring a case for review simply because the Board has remanded the case for further proceedings before an immigration judge. It is likewise irrelevant that there has not been a final decision from the Board  either  granting  or denying relief.	The relevant federal regulation states: “The Board shall refer to the Attorney General for review of its decision all cases that . . . the Attorney General directs the Board to refer to him.” 8 C.F.R § 1003.1(h)(1). Nothing in section 1003.1(h) requires, or even suggests, that the only Board “decisions” the Attorney General can review are final decisions that definitively grant or deny relief to a respondent. Nor do the applicable regulations or the INA define “decision” as  a “final” decision.	See id. § 1001.1 (defining terms in the relevant chapter); 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (defining terms under the Act).

B. Both the respondent and certain amici also raise due process concerns with  my  certification  of  this  matter.	They argue principally that my certification improperly bypassed the Board and deprived it of the opportunity to consider the certified question in the first instance. The Board exercises “only the authority provided by statute or delegated by the Attorney General,” Matter of Castro-Tum, 27 I&N Dec. 271, 282 (A.G. 2018), and the regulations allow the Attorney General to certify any case that is before the Board or where it has rendered a decision, 8 C.F.R § 1003.1(h). In any event, the respondent has already received full and fair opportunities to present her asylum claim before both the immigration judge and the Board. After those proceedings, both the immigration judge and the Board issued written decisions that analyzed the validity of the respondent’s proposed particular social group and whether the respondent qualified for asylum on that ground. The respondent also argues that the certification violated her due process rights	because	alleged	“irregularities”	in	the	certification	“reflect prejudgment of her claim and lack of impartiality, in contravention of her right to a full and fair hearing by a neutral adjudicator.”3 There is no basis

3 The only alleged “irregularity” cited by respondent is the notion that “[g]iven that Respondent’s case was not under active consideration by Judge Couch or the Board at the time of the Attorney General’s referral order, it is not clear how the Attorney General to this claim. The respondent and some amici complain that I have advanced policy views on immigration matters as a U.S. Senator or as Attorney General, but the statements they identify have no bearing upon my ability to faithfully discharge my legal responsibilities in this case. I have made no public statements regarding the facts of respondent’s case, and I have no “personal interest in the outcome of the proceedings.” Strivers v. Pierce, 71 F.3d 732, 741 (9th Cir. 1995).
Nor is there any requirement that an administrator with significant policymaking responsibilities withdraw from “interchange and discussion about important issues.” Ass’n of Nat’l Advertisers, Inc. v. FTC, 627 F.2d 1151, 1168 (D.C. Cir. 1979). As the Supreme Court has held, a decision maker need not be “disqualified simply because he has taken a position, even in public, on a policy issue related to the dispute, in the absence of a showing that he is not ‘capable of judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances.’” Hortonville Joint Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Hortonville Educ. Ass’n, 426 U.S. 482, 493 (1976) (quoting United States v. Morgan,
313 U.S. 409, 421 (1941)). If policy statements about immigration-related issues were a basis for disqualification, then no Attorney General could fulfill his or her statutory obligations to review the decisions of the Board.


III.  I turn now to the question of whether, and under what circumstances, being a victim of private criminal activity constitutes persecution on account of membership in a particular social group.4
A.

An applicant for asylum bears the burden of establishing that she “is a refugee within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A)” of the INA. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A), (B)(i). Under that definition, the applicant must demonstrate that she is an alien outside her country of nationality “who is became aware of Respondent’s case.” Respondent’s Opening Br. at 18 n.5. The Attorney General has the express authority under the INA to review “administrative determinations in immigration proceedings.” 8 U.S.C. § 1103(g)(2). The suggestion that there is something “irregular” about my exercise of that authority is meritless.

4 The respondent in this case also applied for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C § 1231(b)(3) and for protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), see 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c). Because the Board sustained the respondent’s appeal as to her asylum claim, the Board did not address the immigration judge’s denial of her applications for withholding of removal or for CAT protection. See A-B- at *4 (BIA). My opinion addresses only respondent’s asylum claim. On remand, the immigration judge may consider any other issues remaining in the case. unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail . . . herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” Id. § 1101(a)(42)(A). Here, the respondent claims that she is eligible for asylum because of persecution she suffered on account of her purported membership in a particular social group—“El Salvadoran women who are unable to leave their domestic relationships where they have children in common” with their partners. As the Board and the federal courts have repeatedly recognized, the phrase “membership in a particular social group” is ambiguous. Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 232–33; Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 230; Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N at 209; see also, e.g., Ngugi v. Lynch, 826 F.3d 1132, 1138 (8th Cir. 2016); Gonzalez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 820 F.3d 399, 404 (11th Cir. 2016); Henriquez-Rivas v. Holder, 707 F.3d 1081, 1083 (9th  Cir. 2013) (en banc); Mayorga-Vidal v. Holder, 675 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 2012); Valdiviezo-Galdamez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 663 F.3d 582, 612 (3d Cir. 2011). Neither the INA nor the implementing regulations define “particular social group.” 5 “The concept is even more elusive because there is no clear evidence of legislative intent.” Valdiviezo-Galdamez, 663 F.3d at 594. As then-Judge Alito noted for the court, “[r]ead in its broadest literal sense, the phrase is almost completely open-ended. Virtually any set including more than one person could be described as a ‘particular social group.’ Thus, the statutory language standing alone is not very instructive.” Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d 1233, 1238 (3d Cir. 1993) (Alito, J.).The Attorney General has primary responsibility for construing ambiguous provisions in the immigration laws. M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 230; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(g). The INA provides that the “determination and ruling by the Attorney General with respect to all questions of law shall be controlling.” 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1). The Attorney General’s reasonable construction of an ambiguous term in the Act, such as “membership in a particular social group,” is entitled to deference. See Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 980 (2005); Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984); see also Negusie v. Holder, 555 U.S. 511, 516 (2009)

5 One of Congress’s primary purposes in passing the Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102, was to implement the principles agreed to in the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 19 U.S.T. 6223, 606 U.N.T.S. 267 (entered into force Oct. 4, 1967; for the United States Nov. 1, 1968), as well as the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, July 28, 1951, 19 U.S.T. 6259, 189 U.N.T.S. 150 (entered into force Apr. 22, 1954)). See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 436–37 (1987). The Protocol offers little insight into the definition of “particular social group,” which was added to the Protocol “as an afterthought.” Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 232.
