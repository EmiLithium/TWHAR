On My Honor

Why the American Values of the Boy Scouts Are Worth Fighting For

Dedication

To my son Griffin, who persevered in the pursuit of his Eagle in the midst of many distractions common to a young man; my daughter Sydney, who inspires me to appeal to the better angels inside us all; and to my wife Anita, who is eternally patient with all my hobbies but especially supportive of all the time I have dedicated to a more vibrant Scouting movement.
All author profits from this book are dedicated to the Boy Scouts of America, Legal Defense. They continue to be under attack from the forces of secularism, and they can use every bit of financial assistance available from a sympathetic public.

Acknowledgments

My thanks go to several men who were my companions in Scouting or good Scouting comrades as adults. They are Dr. Russell Dressen; Dr. Mike Overton and Waller Overton, sons of Gene Overton, my scoutmaster; Riley Couch and Bill Andrews. They gave generously of their time to share memories of our Scouting days together and gave their views of the efforts of the ACLU and others to force Scouting to change its values.
I asked several men of accomplishment in their fields for their thoughts on Scouting and where it is heading. All were Eagle Scouts, including: U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates; Dr. Gordon Gee, now president of Ohio State University and recent chancellor of Vanderbilt University; Astronaut James Lovell; and former FBI Director William Sessions. They made time for me to interview them, and I greatly appreciate their willingness to do so.
Teresa Hartnett, my literary agent, gave valuable advice about the organization of the book and arranged for its publication. My editors at Stroud & Hall made many good suggestions.
Several senior staff members at the Boy Scouts of America provided historical and organizational information, including David Parks, General Council; Connie Adams, Manager, Records Management; George Trosko, Director of the Boy Scout Division; and Stephen Mendlicott, Director of the Marketing & Communications Division.
George Davidson of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, LLP, the BSA’s outside legal counsel, was helpful in supplying information about the lawsuits in which the Boy Scouts of America has been involved in its fight to maintain its values and criteria. Mindy Schmutter, a paralegal at the firm, was also helpful. 
My former communications director and speechwriter of eight years, Eric Bearse, made numerous edits and suggestions to the manuscript. He has a special gift for putting my most deeply help beliefs into writing. For that I am grateful.
My political consultant, an avid Eagle Scout himself, David Carney, made numerous suggestions for this book and played and invaluable role in keeping the project on target. His ideas were essential.
Robert Hardwicke, a veteran adult Scout leader in California, supplied a useful “grassroots” perspective on current-day Scouting procedures and practices. The research work of Martin Wooster and the many hours of editing by Peter Hannaford are also appreciated.
And finally, with great love and admiration, I would like to acknowledge Gene Overton, my late scoutmaster in Paint Creek, Texas, who inspired and guided me as so many other scout leaders have done for almost a century.

Introduction

You may be wondering, “Why would the governor of the second largest state choose to write his very first book about the Boy Scouts?” Or you may be thinking, “Why should I care what the governor of the second largest state has to say about the Scouts? And who is the governor of the second largest state, anyway?” If your question is the last one, don’t worry; you fit into the same category as the vast majority of Americans. If, however, you asked one of the first two questions, I can assure you this book is for you.
Though these pages contain plenty of my personal thoughts, this book is not about me. To the extent that it is about me is merely a reflection of the fact that I can’t view Scouting from any other perspective than my own. I have fifty years of observations packed inside these pages, but whether you like me more or less after reading them isn’t really what matters. What does matter is whether, after reading this book, you have a more profound appreciation for the impact Scouting has on both young men and women, and what it means to the preservation of a core decency that has defined American society for 200 years. As you will read, I believe that core decency is at risk if our society continues to drift from the virtues of liberty to the vices of license.
I also believe this book demonstrates that the so-called “War on the Scouts” is a microcosm of a larger phenomenon, a “culture war” that has been tearing at the seams of our society for forty years, and that pits traditional values such as service, selflessness. and sacrifice for the common good against a newer doctrine that elevates the self above society and relegates morality to a shapeless form of relativity. The attacks on the Scouts are but one front in a larger war. The forces of moral relativity—the most famous of which is the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)—would remove any mention of God from the public square, would sanitize our society of bright lines dividing right and wrong, and would elevate doing what “feels good” as a moral imperative higher than doing what is necessary for us to live together.
I am passionate about this subject because Scouting was central to my life as a young boy growing up on the rolling plains of West Texas. And it has remained so. I went to Texas A&M, in part, because I held in awe my Aggie scoutmaster, Gene Overton. He took me as a young boy on my first visit to the campus. I knew from that day onward where I wanted to attend college. As an adult and as an assistant scoutmaster, I passed along Scouting’s great traditions to my son. I have never been prouder than I was the day he earned the Scouting’s highest honor, the Eagle Award. As governor of Texas, I have attended numerous Scouting dinners to raise money for local troops and councils, knowing that Scouting’s impact on those young men had the potential to overcome the very different lessons taught by a deteriorating culture.
Once an unassailable American institution, Scouting began coming under attack in 1976. An oregon girl who had been denied membership in a Cub Scout pack sued the Boy Scouts of America for admission. Most Americans probably didn’t think much of that suit at the time because, like me, most didn’t even know about it. I was flying a C-130 on tactical airlifts to South America, Europe, and the Middle East as a pilot in the United States Air Force. As such, I was relearning through international travel what I had been taught as a young Scout: that America is unique because Americans understand that freedom is not the same as license, and that it comes with social obligations. One such obligation is to defend freedom with one’s life, as I was willing to do and many before me and after me have done. In my case, that calling never took me to the field of battle. I was fortunate. Many other have faced the horror of war in order to further freedom, and many of those citizen-soldiers were prepared at a young age in the Boy Scouts of America.
I left the Air Force in 1977 and returned to the family farm and ranch, renewing friendships with old Scouting comrades. They began to tell me about other lawsuits against the BSA. Up to the 1990s, most had to do with membership (that is, girls wanting to join Boy Scout troops or Cub packs) or employment.
As the years went on, the number of lawsuits seemed to increase and the nature of the suits began to change. Now it was atheists suing the Scouts on the basis of “discrimination,” objecting to the pluralistic faith statement in the Scout Oath: “On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God.” 
By then the ACLU was knee-deep in the litigious assault on the Scouts, which, on its face, seemed a little odd and ironic since they are an organization dedicated to free speech. Here they were objecting to another organization expressing its views through the personal beliefs of its members.
Along with suits by atheists, some openly homosexual men who had been denied leadership positions in Scout troops sued the Scouts. Like the atheists, they claimed discrimination. 
What was going on? Scouting’s values are drawn from those of the huge middle class of our nation—a body of people generous to those less fortunate and not envious of those who do well because opportunities are open to nearly everyone.
Reading up on the lawsuits filed against the Boy Scouts of America and some of its units, I saw a clear pattern. The ACLU and its allies seemed determined to force the Boy Scouts to bend to their version of what is right and wrong, with the effort climaxing in 2000 with the Dale case.
In that case, an openly homosexual man in New Jersey claimed that the Boy Scouts violated his state’s anti-discrimination law. The state’s supreme court sided with him. The suit went all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that a state may not prohibit the Boy Scouts from adhering to a moral point of view and expressing it in internal leadership policy. It also held that the New Jersey Supreme Court’s decision violated the Boy Scouts’ First Amendment right to freedom of association.
Most Americans have a live-and-let-live view about homosexuality. After all, many have relatives or acquaintances who are homosexual. Scouting’s leaders have the same tolerant view, but they do not believe that someone whose personal agenda is to make an open issue of his sexual orientation should be a Scout leader. Scouting is not about sex, but about building character.
As for the atheist cases, Scouts, like most Americans, believe in God. Scouting is firmly non-sectarian, but it expects its members to express a belief in the Almighty, and to live according to that faith in their daily lives.
The Dale case seemed to clear the way for the Scouts to go forward with their stated mission, the Scout Law, and the Scout Oath, but the ACLU and its allies had other ideas. They have since changed tactics, stepping up with their assault on the Scouts through a series of threats and suits intended to prevent Scout groups from using public facilities for their meetings. Are these acts revenge for the Dale case ruling? Only they know, but isn’t it odd that the ACLU, which champions First Amendment rights, wants them applied selectively? It seems some of the most intolerant acts occur in the name of tolerance: a paradox that seems to describe much of the ACLU’s political agenda.
As I became involved in public service, and my son ascended through the Scouting ranks, my passion for Scouting and my desire to see this American institution treated fairly led me to study the cases and to talk with Scouting leaders about the larger issues of which the assault on the Boy Scouts was a part.

The Culture War
It's called the culture war today, but when it began in the 1960s and '70s, it didn't have a name. Student campus unrest, rejection of authority, the "self-esteem" movement, moral relativism, and the demands of secularists all gradually fused into a series of attacks on American institutions.
It's not that the public didn't have a right to be "skeptical" about institutions such as government (after all, President Nixon, in the Watergate affairs, damaged public trust in the presidency), but the counterculture movement seemed to move beyond a healthy skepticism to a poisonous form of cynicism. Instead of reforming the institution of government, some advocated simply “tuning out” and turning to the carnage of mind-altering addiction.
Others seems to have a more sinister motive than mere self-indulgence. The objectives of radicals seemed to tear away at the foundations of our society, attacking the role of faith, undermining the role of family, and exploiting freedom to push a divisive agenda of permissiveness. From time to time, the outgrowth of this movement has been captured in the public eye by symbolic attacks on beloved symbols and cherished traditions. Radical file suits to drive religion from the public square and eliminate references to God from the Pledge of Allegiance, currency, and government buildings. They have used lifetime appointments on the judicial bench to advance by decision that which they can’t achieve by legislation. They have created a climate of paranoia in our schools, making teachers and administrators into sensitivity police who feel compelled to scold children for wishing someone a Merry Christmas or bringing a classmate a gift. And, as we shall see in the succeeding chapters, they attacked a century-old American institution, the Boy Scouts of America, to make it fit their narrow view of the world.
In this book you will learn…
WHO is behind the attacks on the Boy Scouts;
WHAT they have done and are doing to force the Scouts to bend to their will;
WHERE they have launched their attacks;
HOW they intend to remake Scouting and how the Boy Scouts are fighting back.
Although the first attacks on the Boy Scouts seemed isolated and uncoordinated thirty years ago, we now see them as part of a larger movement to redefine American values. If viewed in isolation, one might be tempted to see these attacks as a small affair with little relevance to the lives of most Americans. If seen, however, in the wider context of a great debate taking place in our society, with the attacks on Scouting being merely symptomatic of the clash about the relevancy of traditional American values, then one is more likely to join the chorus of the once silent majority who are now beginning to speak out about protecting the role of faith and family in our society, and preventing the corrosive impact of the culture on our children.
Scouts, their parents, and their leaders care about the outcome of these assaults on Scouting. Even if you are not one of these, you should care, too. We are close to a tipping point in American society. If you believe there is right and wrong, that there are acceptable standards of behavior, that ethics cannot be made up on the spot, that judges should base their decisions on interpretations of the law not currently popular opinion, and that this is a nation founded on a belief in God (George Washington called it “Divine Providence”), then you have a stake in this war.
If the attackers win many more victories—either through intimidation, threatened lawsuits, or rulings from kindred judges—the culture war may be lost before we know it. If that happens, we will find ourselves living in a world where moral relativism reigns and individualism runs amok. Now is the time to enlist in this effort, to stand up and be counted.
My perspective is that of an Eagle Scout who worked years to obtain Scouting’s highest recognition and who encouraged his son to pursue the same path. I will tell you how Scouting shaped my life and prepared me for young adult challenges, such as serving in the Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M University, flying C-130 tactical airlift in the United States Air Force, and undertaking a career in elected public service, beginning in 1985.
For this book, I have intereviewed a number of former Scouts—including some prominent Eagle Scouts—to probe the impact of Scouting on their lives. I’ve also related the stories of several boys whose Scouting experience made major positive changes in their lives.
I have reviewed what the opponents of Scouting have been saying, too. Despite their assumption that the Boy Scout movement is static, it is not. It is dynamic, and in these pages I will show you both Scouting’s history and the changes it has made over time to remain relevant to each new generation of young people.
In these chapters I have examined in detail the issues that have led to the attacks on Scouting and the forces in American society that have organized and carried out those attacks. I have discussed the tactics of those seeking to drive God from the public square and the irony that those who attack the Scouts in the name of religious freedom will, if successful, actually suppress freedom of religion. The book also explains the Scouts’ refusal to bend to the winds of “political correctness” by allowing activist homosexual scoutmasters.
The ramifications of the legal challenges to Scouting are examined, including how the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) has responded and—essentially—prevailed. Examining recent polling data, I have compared Scouting’s program and values with broader trends in values in American society. As you will see, Scouting’s values fit closely with those of society as a whole.
What of the future? In the final chapter, I discuss the choice facing Scouting and American society as a whole—a choice between retaining a set of values encapsulated by a dedication to service to others (and the institutions that carry those values and service forward) on the one hand, and the forces of nihilism and self-centeredness on the other.
When you have completed reading On My Honor, I hope you will agree with me that the American values of the Boy Scouts are definitely worth keeping and fighting for.
