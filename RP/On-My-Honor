On My Honor

Why the American Values of the Boy Scouts Are Worth Fighting For

Dedication

To my son Griffin, who persevered in the pursuit of his Eagle in the midst of many distractions common to a young man; my daughter Sydney, who inspires me to appeal to the better angels inside us all; and to my wife Anita, who is eternally patient with all my hobbies but especially supportive of all the time I have dedicated to a more vibrant Scouting movement.
All author profits from this book are dedicated to the Boy Scouts of America, Legal Defense. They continue to be under attack from the forces of secularism, and they can use every bit of financial assistance available from a sympathetic public.

Acknowledgments

My thanks go to several men who were my companions in Scouting or good Scouting comrades as adults. They are Dr. Russell Dressen; Dr. Mike Overton and Waller Overton, sons of Gene Overton, my scoutmaster; Riley Couch and Bill Andrews. They gave generously of their time to share memories of our Scouting days together and gave their views of the efforts of the ACLU and others to force Scouting to change its values.
I asked several men of accomplishment in their fields for their thoughts on Scouting and where it is heading. All were Eagle Scouts, including: U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates; Dr. Gordon Gee, now president of Ohio State University and recent chancellor of Vanderbilt University; Astronaut James Lovell; and former FBI Director William Sessions. They made time for me to interview them, and I greatly appreciate their willingness to do so.
Teresa Hartnett, my literary agent, gave valuable advice about the organization of the book and arranged for its publication. My editors at Stroud & Hall made many good suggestions.
Several senior staff members at the Boy Scouts of America provided historical and organizational information, including David Parks, General Council; Connie Adams, Manager, Records Management; George Trosko, Director of the Boy Scout Division; and Stephen Mendlicott, Director of the Marketing & Communications Division.
George Davidson of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, LLP, the BSA’s outside legal counsel, was helpful in supplying information about the lawsuits in which the Boy Scouts of America has been involved in its fight to maintain its values and criteria. Mindy Schmutter, a paralegal at the firm, was also helpful. 
My former communications director and speechwriter of eight years, Eric Bearse, made numerous edits and suggestions to the manuscript. He has a special gift for putting my most deeply help beliefs into writing. For that I am grateful.
My political consultant, an avid Eagle Scout himself, David Carney, made numerous suggestions for this book and played and invaluable role in keeping the project on target. His ideas were essential.
Robert Hardwicke, a veteran adult Scout leader in California, supplied a useful “grassroots” perspective on current-day Scouting procedures and practices. The research work of Martin Wooster and the many hours of editing by Peter Hannaford are also appreciated.
And finally, with great love and admiration, I would like to acknowledge Gene Overton, my late scoutmaster in Paint Creek, Texas, who inspired and guided me as so many other scout leaders have done for almost a century.
