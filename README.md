We can collaborate here to collect writing samples on some of the TWH Senior Admin (SA).

## Workflow

We might want to work on SA's individually so we don't get any duplicate writing samples. You can assign an SA to yourself in the `Issues` tab.

1. Upload writing samples as `.txt` files into the SA's corresponding folder. Make sure the full contents of the `.txt` file is a sample of the suspect's writing. 
1. If you have observations or questions on your SA, you can leave comments in their thread in the `Issues` tab.
1. Once you have 6500 words collected on your SA, you can close their issue in the `Issues` tab. Honestly, if you can only find 2000 words that might be okay. We can take that case-by-case.

## What if I accidentally mess with someone else's folder?

Create a branch for yourself. You'll be able to merge the branch later without any conflicts with the master branch.
