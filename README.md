We can collaborate here to collect writing samples on some of the TWH Senior Admin (SA).

## Workflow

We might want to work on SA's individually so we don't get any duplicate writing samples. You can assign an SA to yourself in the `Issues` tab.

1. Find the list of SA's in the `Issues` tab.
1. Assign one to yourself.
1. If you have observations or comments on the SA you can leave comments in the issues thread.
1. [Create a new folder for your SA](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Creating-new-folders-in-GitHub-repository-via-the-browser) and name it using initials. You can create this folder with a blank `.txt` file you can delete later, or with a real writing sample named `anything.txt`.
1. Once you have 6500 words collected on your SA, you can close their issue in the `Issues` tab. Honestly, if you can only find 2000 words that might be okay. We can take that case-by-case.

## What if I accidentally mess with someone else's folder?

You don't have to but if you're paranoid you can create a branch for yourself. You'll be able to merge the branch back in later without any conflicts with the master branch.
