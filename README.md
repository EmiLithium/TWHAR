# Read Me

We can collaborate here to collect writing samples on some of the TWH Senior Admin (SA). Read this for workflow instructions.

## Workflow

We might want to work on SA's individually so we don't get any duplicate writing samples. We can keep track of assignments in the `Issues` tab, **although ultimately you will be uploading `.txt` files in the `<> Code` tab.**

1. Find the list of SA's in the `Issues` tab and assign one to yourself.
1. If you have observations or comments on the SA you can leave comments in the issues thread.
1. Save your writing samples as `.txt` files. **Upload them in the `<> Code` tab.**
1. [Create a new folder for your SA](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Creating-new-folders-in-GitHub-repository-via-the-browser) and name it using initials. Click the link to see instructions on creating a folder. You can create this folder with a blank `.txt` file you can delete later, or with a real writing sample named `anything.txt`.
1. Once you have 6500 words collected on your SA, close their issue in the `Issues` tab. Honestly, if you can only find 2000 words, that might be okay. We can take that case-by-case.

## What if I accidentally mess with someone else's folder?

You don't have to, but if you're paranoid, you can create a branch for yourself. You'll be able to merge the branch back in later and address conflicts/unexpected changes with the master branch.
