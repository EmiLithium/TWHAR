# Instructions

1. Create a folder for your person.
1. Upload writing samples as `.txt` files into the corresponding folder. Make sure the full contents of the `.txt` file is a sample of the person's writing.

If you're worried about messing with someone else's folder, create a branch for yourself! You'll be able to merge the branch later without any conflicts with the master branch.
